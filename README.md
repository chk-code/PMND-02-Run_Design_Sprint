# PMND-02-Run_Design_Sprint
Udacity's Product Manager Nanodegree, PROJECT 02: Run a Design Sprint

FINAL REVIEW: https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/2160440

Detailed Instructions
A Design Sprint is a cross-functional exercise with team members participating from a number of different roles across your company (Design, Product, Eng, Marketing, etc).

In this Design Sprint project, you’ll be going through the exercises on your own and we will simulate some of the group activities related to brainstorming.

0. Set the Stage
You will start a PRD that can be shared with the team to set the stage about why this problem matters. The first part of the PRD will include:

Any relevant background information
A problem statement which communicates the scope of the problem
Initial goals, which can continue to evolve throughout the project
1. Understand
Create a shared understanding of the problem space and identify opportunities through a “How Might We” exercise.

Create at least 20 virtual stickies that ask questions following the "How Might We" model

Opportunities. Not solutions.
Not too broad, and not too narrow
One idea per sticky
Get input from other members of your digital "team"

Open the Google Slides deck that corresponds with your project
Copy three slides back into your deck
Sort and group the stickies

Place any stickies that do not follow the "How Might We" model into an "other" cluster
Group similar stickies together into clusters and label each cluster
Group similar clusters together into themes -- one per slide -- and label the title of the slide with the theme
Pick one theme that you want to move forward with and explain your rationale for selecting that theme

2. Define
By defining and focusing on the desired outcomes, you’ll be able to more clearly understand how to get there.

Define success metrics - Identify goals along with the signals and metrics that can be used to measure them using the HEART framework. This will be helpful later on, as you’ve already outlined what your project needs to do in order to be successful.

Start by identifying at least two user-centered goals
Then identify what signals from user behavior will affect reaching each specific goal
Finally, create metrics derived from those signals can be measured
Write a future press review
Think about how you want users to respond to your product:
Who is it for?
What problem does it solve?
How does it change a customer’s life?
Why should customers love it?
Use that information to draft a review from the perspective of the user
3. Sketch
Generate ideas for possible solutions based on the theme that you selected.

Create 8 quick sketches to quickly generate a few ideas.

Take a sheet of paper and fold it into 8 sections
Sketch an idea in each of the 8 sections
Spend about 1-2 minutes per sketch
Pick two to develop into more detailed flows that clarify how the solution would work.

Spend about 30 minutes per sketch
Sketch your idea in more detail than the last exercise -- use text annotations if needed
Create at least 3 frames that show how the user progresses through the flow
Include a title
Sketches -- quick and detailed
Sketches -- Quick and Detailed

4. Decide
Pick the final concept that you want to develop into a prototype

Pick your most compelling solution sketch

Explain why it’s the most compelling

5. Prototype
Turn your concept into a realistic, interactive prototype that you will use to validate your assumptions and ideas

Storyboard - Create a storyboard based on your best solution sketch. We’ll use the storyboard as the blueprint to create the prototype.
The storyboard should:

Be high fidelity enough to build a prototype:
Detail the steps a user goes through and how they progress from one step to the next
Detail the layout of the software experience (wireframe level detail)
Cover the entire user journey (ie: things that can happen outside the software experience)
What prompts the user to use this?
Storyboard
Storyboard

Prototype - Create an interactive prototype to showcase your concept
Create mocks based on your storyboard using the Figma prototyping tool
Use the prototype tool to define the flows
Describe the concept that your prototype captures
Describe the flows/tasks a user can complete in your prototype
Health app prototype
Figma Prototype

6. Validate
Users will go through your prototype and provide feedback on your concept. This is also an opportunity to have an engineering feasibility discussion

Create a Research Plan
Create a research plan
Identify your target user
Map out the flow of the interview
Intro
Background information
Tasks
Wrap Up
Run User Studies - Inviting users in to participate in studies is a great way to get feedback if you are on the right track. Additionally, it’s also easier to course correct at this point before any code has been written. We’re going to invite 2 users to try out the prototype that you built. You’ll use the research plan you created to guide the study and will record the audio from the session. You should also plan to take notes during the session.

Schedule two meetings with people you can interview about your prototype
Note: It might not be possible to find someone who meets your target user criteria-- and that’s ok for the sake of this exercise
Run through your interview script in the research plan.
You will ask some background questions to the participant and then ask them to complete several tasks
Make sure to take notes during the interview (you can use the research plan as a template for notes)
You should record the audio of the interview
You should plan to spend about 30 minutes per interview
Prepare for a feasibility conversation - Now that you’ve created an interactive prototype of your concept, it’s important to make sure that it can actually be built. Engage with engineering early on, to make sure you understand the tradeoffs of how design decisions can impact timelines. Prepare to have a feasibility conversation with your engineering team or lead.

Map out dynamic elements that are displayed in your UI
Identify where you assume the underlying data is coming from
List questions you have around these assumptions
Map out what data you collect from your users (ie: text input field) and how it will be used
Identify where you assume this data is being stored
List questions you have around these assumptions
Map out your expectations around latency
Identify things that you think might increase latency
List questions you have around these assumptions
7. Iterate
Leverage learnings from your first two user interviews to make changes to your prototype. Then run another round of user interviews.

Course correct

Pick the top two issues that you identified in the previous user interviews
Explain your rationale for wanting to address those two issues
Update your Figma file to address those two issues
More user studies

Schedule one meeting with people you can interview about your prototype (not the same people as before)
Note: It might not be possible to someone who meets your target user criteria-- and that’s ok for the sake of this exercise
Run through your interview script in the research plan.
You will ask some background questions to the participant and then ask them to complete several tasks
Make sure to take notes during the interview (you can use the research plan as a template for notes)
You should record the audio of the interview
You should plan to spend about 30 minutes per interview
8. Handoff
Refine the problem and goals section (if needed)
Complete the Key Features and Scope section
Link your mocks to the PRD
